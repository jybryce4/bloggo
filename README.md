# The Bloggo Project
*Bloggo* is a social media site created with C# and ASP.NET Core.
Similar to the popular platform, Tumblr, *Bloggo* will allow users to create and edit posts of any length, upvote/downvote posts, react to posts in a style similar to Facebook reactions, comment, and *rebloggo* posts. Additionally, users will be able to create tags to organize similar posts and to be seen by other users more easily.

## Projected Timeline
This section details each piece of The *Bloggo* Project and when it is expected to be completed.
